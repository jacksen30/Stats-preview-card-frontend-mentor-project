# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is my personal solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). I completed it using basic HTML and CSS. I would appreciate any feedback on best practices that I've missed as well as suggestions on any code that could be refactored to be more efficient.
